                            I am also a CIS121 TA, which is the university's Data Structures and Algorithms course.

                            Last year, I had the opportunity to join the Wharton VIP-X program, which is a selective entreprenuerial accelerator program at Penn. There,
                            my friends and I grew our non-profit healthcare startup with the help of advisors, entreprenurial talks, and seed-funding.

                            College has opened my eyes to fields I never thought I would study. Coursewise, I was exposed to the likes of philosophy, capitalism, human computation,
                            and even design principles! From my theory-based coursework to my application-heavy extracirriculars, I am so fortunate to be able to learn from
                            multiple fields and gain friends along the way üòÉ.

                            On campus, I really enjoy going out and trying new restuarants. Fun fact: my favorite food is pizza üçï!

                            Recently, I have gotten into watching food videos, such as Ramsay in 10, fried chicken sandwich reviews, and Mikey Chen vlogs.

                            Other than that, I like hanging out with my friends, whether that be going on walks, driving around,
                            playing board games, or teaming up on League of Legends!
