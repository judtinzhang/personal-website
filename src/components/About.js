                            I am also a CIS121 TA, which is the university's Data Structures and Algorithms course.

                            Last year, I had the opportunity to join the Wharton VIP-X program, which is a selective entrepreneurial accelerator program at Penn. There,
                            my friends and I grew our non-profit healthcare startup with the help of advisors, entrepreneurial talks, and seed funding.

                            College has opened my eyes to fields I never thought I would study. Coursewise, I was exposed to the likes of philosophy, capitalism, human computation,
                            and even design principles! From my theory-based coursework to my application-heavy extracurriculars, I am so fortunate to be able to learn from
                            multiple fields and gain amazing friends along the way üòÉ.

                            On campus, I really enjoy going out and trying new restaurants. Fun fact: my favorite food is pizza üçï!

                            Recently, I have gotten into watching food-related videos such as Ramsay in 10, numerous fried chicken sandwich reviews, and <HyperLink href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjkGXhZsu5H64fWuNQNf1Xw" target="_blank">Mikey Chen vlogs</HyperLink>.

                            Other than that, I like hanging out with my friends, whether that be going on walks, driving around,
                            playing board games, or teaming up on League of Legends!

                            I am also really big into movies and TV shows (thriller, action, adventure, sci-fi, romance, anime, kdrama... you name it!), and I listen to Spotify for at least 90 minutes a day üéµ.
